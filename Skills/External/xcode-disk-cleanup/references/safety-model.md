# Safety model

## Permission boundary

A request to inspect, audit, find space, or clean Xcode authorizes read-only
discovery. A category-level request after an audit may select the current
eligible candidates, but mutation begins only after the agent presents the
fully enumerated, current candidate ID set. A subsequent unambiguous request
to remove that category is the single approval of that exact frozen set. After
revalidation, execute in the same turn; no magic phrase, repeated IDs, or
additional confirmation is required.

An irreversible Simulator operation still needs explicit category-specific
intent after its identifiers and permanent data loss are shown. That intent may
be a distinct clause in the same message that approves ordinary cleanup; it
does not require another message.

Approval expires when:

- The candidate path, inode, ownership, or purpose changes
- A build or simulator starts using the candidate
- The audit is no longer current enough to trust and revalidation cannot prove
  the same ID, identity, risk, and action. An unchanged refreshed audit preserves
  approval.
- The proposed action changes from Trash to permanent deletion
- A reversible action changes into an irreversible API operation

## Risk levels

### Regenerable

Generated build products, indexes, package downloads, and caches. These still
require confirmation because deletion can trigger hours of rebuilding or downloads
and can disrupt other agents.

### Destructive

Simulator devices, installers, DeviceSupport, and Xcode applications. Data may be
redownloadable, but local state or offline recovery is lost.

### Preserve

Archives, dSYMs, unknown documentation, active Xcodes, unique toolchains, signing
assets, credentials, and anything with uncertain ownership or recovery.

## Mutation rules

- Prefer supported Xcode, SwiftPM, and `simctl` commands.
- Move ordinary paths to Trash; never follow symlinks.
- Do not empty Trash without separate confirmation.
- Reject wildcard IDs and broad path prefixes.
- Recheck active builds, tests, archives, package resolution, and exact candidate
  usage immediately before mutation. An open Xcode or Simulator application by
  itself is not a blocker.
- For regenerable documentation caches, warn that local documentation may be
  temporarily unavailable while Xcode reloads it; do not require Xcode or
  Simulator to quit solely for that reason.
- Refuse a path when its inode/device no longer matches the audit.
- Avoid `sudo`; do not disable SIP or alter protected system assets.
- Do not manually remove `/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator`,
  `/System/Library/AssetsV2`, or an entire CoreSimulator device set.

## APFS accounting

`du` measures logical blocks reachable through a path. APFS clones, snapshots, and
shared volumes mean candidate sizes are not necessarily additive. Measure actual
free-space change with `df` after cleanup and state when files remain in Trash.
